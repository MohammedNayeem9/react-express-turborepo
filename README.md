# React-Express TurboRepo (NPM)

This project is a template for setting up a TurboRepo that integrates a React client and an Express server. The goal is to create a fast, scalable, and organized codebase for full-stack applications.

## Features

- **TurboRepo**: Efficiently manage builds and tasks across the client and server.
- **React**: Build dynamic user interfaces with a responsive design.
- **Express**: Create a powerful API for handling requests and serving data.
- **Concurrent Development**: Both client and server run simultaneously for streamlined development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes bundled with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control

## Installation

Follow these steps to clone the repository and install the dependencies:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Open your terminal and run the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohammedNayeem9/react-express-turborepo.git

   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd react-express

   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

Use npm to install the necessary packages for both the client and server

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Project

To start both the client and the server simultaneously, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will run the development server using TurboRepo, which will start both the React client and the Express server.

- The client will be available at http://localhost:3000.
- The server will be available at http://localhost:5001.

## Environment Variables

If your project requires any environment variables (like database URIs, API keys, etc.), create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your variables like so:

```bash
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

Make sure to add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid pushing sensitive information.

## Testing

To run tests for the client or server, navigate to their respective directories and run:

```bash
# For the client
cd client
npm test

# For the server
cd server
npm test
```
